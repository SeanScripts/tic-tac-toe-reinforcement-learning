# tic-tac-toe-reinforcement-learning
 A simple python implementation of a tic tac toe "AI" developed through reinforcement learning. With only a short training time, it learns something close to the optimal strategy, but in this simple game, it is possible to hard-code an opponent with the optimal strategy. This was a fun project that I did to try to better understand one specific type of reinforcement learning.
